additions that I chose:
	When choosing uploads the choices will be displayed as a tree view of 
	the contents of the directory and all the sub directories.
	The file that you selected at the start can be changed while the program
	is running

notes:
	The lists in the UI update every 7.5 seconds.
	when the UI is updated the lists will deselect your current input.
	The sever and client programs can both be run from run scripts within their
	project files, but the starting directory in the default run script is the
	cilent directory and IP is local host.
	The downloaded files will be stored in the client directory regardless of
	which directory the client is in.
